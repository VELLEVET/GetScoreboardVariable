This plugin can be used for getting some Scoreboard values.
To use this, you have to to GET-request with some parameters: act, specific additional info and, probably, pass, if you're trying to get blacklisted objectives.
1. Unitary value:
    0) act = value
    1) vname = objective name
    2) pname = player name
    3) pass = passphrase (necessary only if you try to get blacklisted objective)
2. Rating:
    0) act = top
    1) vname = objective name
    2) size = depth of rating
    3) min = minimal value (not necessary)
    4) pass = passphrase (necessary only if you try to get blacklisted objective)
